Semaphore Notes:

Semaphore usage:
    Positive values => unlocked
    Negative values => locked

    int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value)
        Initialize unnamed semaphore referred to by sem
        Semaphore remains usable until it's destoryed
        pshared != 0 => semaphore shared between processes

    sem_t *sem_open(const char *name)
        Establishes connection between named semaphore and process
    int sem_wait(sem_t *sem)
        Locks semaphore, won't return from call until it locks the semaphore or is interrupted
    int sem_trywait(sem_t *sem)
        Locks semaphore referenced by sem only if it isn't currently locked
    int sem_post(sem_t *sem)
        Unlocks semaphore
    int sem_close(sem_t *sem)
        Indicates calling process is finished using semaphore
